Developement Guide
==================

This guide provides instructions for setting up an environment for developing
nmrglue and an overview of the project layout and contribution process.


Requirements
------------

To create an environment for developing nmrglue the following must be installed
and available.

* `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_

* `SciPy <http://scipy.org>`_

* `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

* `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_

* `git <http://git-scm.com>`_

In addition the following Python packages are highly recommended. 

* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_

* `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_

A easy way of obtaining and installing these packages is to use a Python 
distribution which provides these packages, such as 
`EPD <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_.  Detailed information on
`installing a Scipy stack <http://scipy.github.com/install.html>`_ is 
available.

Finally, other NMR software packages must be installed to process and convert 
the test and example data.  These are not required for using nmrglue, but are
needed to verify its functionality and to run some of the examples.

* `NMRPipe <http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/>`_

* `Sparky <http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/>`_

* `The Rowland NMR Toolkit <http://rnmrtk.uchc.edu/rnmrtk/RNMRTK.html>`_

* `SIMPSON <http://bionmr.chem.au.dk/bionmr/software/simpson.php>`_
